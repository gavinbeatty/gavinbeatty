# Use this instead of diff[1] to get colored[2] word-based diffs.
# Useful for text documents that have reflowed paragraphs.
# Requires that wdiff is installed in your $PATH.
#
# [1] All diff options are ignored. Only replaces simplest usage.
# [2] Colors are always emitted. If piping into less, use "-R" or set LESS=-R

# The -3 option to wdiff gives no context, so I'm getting wdiff to spit out the
# whole document and using grep to trim it down. The regex for grep could be
# improved, but for text documents is probably ok, and at worst will include
# some extra output that can be ignored..

# CAREFUL: The line above contains an escape character.
# Don't copy the grep command by typing ^[ instead of 

# This grep line hits false positives more often for me:
