# external scripts

These are scripts collected from around the internet. Either the script
contains its copyright and licensing information or it never offered any. All
copyright and licensing rights, etc., lie with the original holder(s) -- I make
no claims on these scripts, and only store them here for ease of use, since
they were originally linked to in blog posts, etc.
