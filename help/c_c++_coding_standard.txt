# Constants on left of == comparisons

    // yes
    if(5 == current) { }
    // no
    if(current == 5) { }
    // prevents (note missing =)
    if(current = 5) { }

## Never use bitwise ops (& | ~ ^ << >>) on signed data

The C Standard doesn't specify signed impl (2's Compliment etc.) so the
operation is undefined.

## Never mix signed and unsigned types

    uint8_t a = 6u;
    int8_t b = -9;
    if(a+b < 4) {
       // meant to be executed but won't
    } else {
       // (0xFF - 9) + 6 = 252
       // this is executed
    }
