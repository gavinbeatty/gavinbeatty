% Terminal 256 colors

# tmux

Put the following in your tmux.conf:

    set -g default-terminal "screen-256color"

Unfortunately, that's not enough, so you should also start tmux with "-2":

    tmux -2 new

Add an alias to do this.


# vim

Vim has some trouble detecting this as well, even in Vim 7.3. Add this
to your vimrc:

    set t_Co=256
    " or let &t_Co=256


# test

You can test whether it has succeeded with [this script](http://www.robmeerman.co.uk/_media/unix/256colors2.pl).
