## Employment

### Optiver Amsterdam: Senior Software Engineer

I write high performance gateways connecting our auto-traders with multiple
exchanges/platforms: including complex order logic, extremely high volume multicast
traffic. I co-maintain our core in-house global library, I solely maintain several
gateways, components, and own-initiative innovation projects.

### Attached to Studio Sophisti, Amsterdam: Freelance iOS developer

### Google Summer of Code: Student Software Engineer

**Summer of 2007**

I applied for and successfully completed my [Google Summer of
Code](http://code.google.com/soc/2007) project entitled "KDEPrint â€“ add support for
LinuxPrinting's on-line drivers query." I implemented a very speedy GUI-wizard to query,
download and install the correct driver for the user's given printer, written entirely in
C++, using a web query language, streamed XML parsing and the KDE/Qt libraries (all
cross-platform). This was a Unix-only application by design, at the time there being no
printer driver repository for other platforms. It installed packages in the given
Linux/Unix distribution's chosen package format, e.g., .deb for Debian/Ubuntu etc.

## Education

### Trinity College, Dublin University: Mathematics

Aside from my studies, I gave basic tutorials in Numerical Analysis through C and Unix
